# zowber-portfolio-go
Go version of my portfolio.

Pulls data from mongodb and renders out to html via a couple of templates.

The aim here is to be as simple as possible vs. the previous versions of my portfolio which used next, react, angular, and a whole bunch of code written by other people.

I guess I've just been feeling nostalgic for the days when I was building websites and apps with php. Back when optimisation and security was mostly the personal responsibility of the developer.
